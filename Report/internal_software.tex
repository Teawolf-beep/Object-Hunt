\section{Internal Software}

The in this section described processes are internal processes, i.e. running on the robot itself. In total there are three custom processes running on the robot. Figure \ref{fig:software} shows the structure of the developed software. This section focuses on the base and the navigation process. The image streaming process is referenced in section \ref{sec:image_processing}.
