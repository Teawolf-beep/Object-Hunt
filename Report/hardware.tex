\section{Hardware}

The hardware of the device can be separated in two subsystems. On the one hand, the robot, which will navigate in the environment, on the other hand the external computer with a static location. This section only focuses on the hardware of the robot. The hardware of the external computer is not further described in this report as any arbitrary recent computer with a working WiFi interface can be used.

Following you will find a short description and the use case of each part used in the robot. All parts mentioned in this section will be combined to one mobile robotic system.

\subsection{Chassis}\label{subsec:chassis}

The chassis forms the foundation of the robot. It consists out of two identical floors, arranged above each other. 

\subsection{Gear Motors}\label{subsec:gear_motors}

Every movement the robot as a unit can make, is realized through four direct current gear motors, each attached to a wheel. Since the \nameref{subsec:processing_unit} can not operate the gear motors directly, dedicated motor drivers are needed in order to operate the gear motors properly.
