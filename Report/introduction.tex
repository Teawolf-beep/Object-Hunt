\section{Introduction}

This research project has the objective to design a mobile system that is able to search and identify an object while navigating in an unknown environment. Furthermore it builds a map of its surroundings and logs the navigated route. The action of searching and identifying an object will further be referenced as hunting. As the mobile system on its own only offers limited computing powers, it will outsource computing intensive tasks to external computers.
